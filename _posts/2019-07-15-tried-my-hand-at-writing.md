title: "So I Wrote a Book"

So, I wrote a book and posted it on amazon.com.

The title is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TWK3FRY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=chrismurphysb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07TWK3FRY&linkId=3a7b3f433df32b5d00b9df46dec2532f">Why Is The Government of the United States So Hard To Do?</a> (Yes, I know the title sucks, but it was intentional.)

The basic premise of the book is that we, as Americans, complain and complain and complain that our government is inefficient and slow and cumbersome and keeps going around in circles (kinda like this sentence), and we just want someone to come in and make it run the way it is supposed to.

The problem is that it is running just as it was designed to run.

It is supposed to be slow.

It is supposed to be inefficient.

It is supposed to be cumbersome.

Laws are supposed to get passed and then get struck down by the courts.

Presidents are supposed to fight with Congress.

Congress is supposed to fight amongst themselves and occasionally get some laws passed and not just budgets.

Efficient governments tend to be dictatorships, and we don't really want that, do we?

No, seriously, anyone with their hand up should probably put it down and re-read the U.S. Constitution (which <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07TMGHL4J/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=chrismurphysb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07TMGHL4J&linkId=ebdbe528feee64ffce97d9e75b11dfcb">I also published</a> for your reading pleasure.)

Now, you don't really understand the purpose of the Constitution unless you read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RX48CHM/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=chrismurphysb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07RX48CHM&linkId=560ab8109096b292bb4b83121e1fb195">Federalist Papers</a> (which I just so happen to have published, too.)

What can I say? It was a slow month.
