[TNReady](https://www.tn.gov/education/assessment/tnready.html) is the state assessment test for Tennessee public school students.

It is administered every year starting in third grade through high school.

I guess the scores are considered "End of Course" assessments in High School and TNReady is just for Elementary and Middle Schools. 

The 2019 scores for 3-8 grades expressed as percent scores are 

| Subject        | Subgroup      | Below | Approaching | On Track | Mastered |
| -------------- |:-------------:| -----:| -----------:| --------:| --------:|
| English        | All Students  |  21.2 |     44.1    |     27.8 |    6.0   |
| Math           | All Students  |  24.3 |     34.9    |     30.1 |   10.7   |
| Social Studies | All Students  |  29.6 |     29.6    |     30.6 |   10.2   |

This means 40.8 % of the students are on grade or above in math in 3-8 grades.

This is not good.

In a future where we need everyone to help figure out difficult problems, we need this basic skill.
