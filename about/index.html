        		<h1>About Chris Murphy</h1>
                <p>I have always had an affinity for computers and code.  Ever since I got my first pulp coding book and set it on my lap and started hammering out the lines  of code on my Commodore 64, I have enjoyed seeing what computers could do.</p>
                <p>I have been coding PHP professionally since around 2004. Before that I was working in Filemaker Pro at my college bookstore and integrating it with Amazon Web Services.  PHP became the language for our website and Filemaker and PHP were using a shared MySQL Db to control inventory.</p>
                <p>After the bookstore, I started working with USAID.  At first I was a contractor, then as a government employee.</p>
                <p>Starting in 2017, I worked on a remote-first team on a project for the federal CIO.  This was a great project and team, but due to the inner workings of government contracting, the project moved to a new agency and new contractor. Philosophically, I think it was the correct move on the government's part, but I hated that it broke up the team. Oh, well.</p>
				<p>I am currently living in Britol, TN..</a></p>
